Lecture 1: Inheritance (Extending Classes):

Hierarchy
	- Superclass (Parent, Base Class) - The class giving its members to its child class

	- Subclass (Child, Derived Class) - The class taking members from its base class

		Subclass : Superclass (subclass inherits superclass (all its properties, methods and fields)

Reusing constructors

	Constructors are not inherited, so they have to be reused by the child classes using the base keyword.

	Student : Person
	public Student(string name, School school) : base(name)
	{
		...
	}

	Derived class instance contains instance of its base class.

	In C#, there is not multiple inheritance, one class can inherit only one class, while one class can be inherited by a lot of classes.
	The only way to achieve multiple inheritance is by Interfaces.
