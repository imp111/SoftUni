Crons:----------------------------------------------------
/opt/alt/php81/usr/bin/php -q /home/galactikh/public_html/clients/crons/cron.php

/opt/alt/php81/usr/bin/php -q - Path to the PHP version on the server
/home/galactikh/public_html/clients/crons/cron.php - path to the cron in the File Manager

/var/log/cron - cron logs
grep "cron name" /var/log/cron - check if a cron is executed


IP logs on firewall:--------------------------------------
grep “ip….” /var/log/lfd.log → The log contains any failed login attempts, as well as IP addresses that have been blocked by CSF.
grep “ip….” /etc/csf/csf.deny → Contains lists of IP addresses that have been blocked. For each entry, it shows the date the IP address was blocked and the reason.
grep “ip….” /etc/csf/csf.allow → Contains lists of IP addresses that have been whitelisted.
grep “ip….” /usr/local/cpanel/logs/login_log → good place to check details why an IP is getting blocked (but run this before the IP is being unblocked from the firewall deny list).

Glue records:
We are not the domain registrar:
From what I can see the Registrar of the domain exampleDomain is registrar.

To configure custom name servers, you need to follow two steps:
    From your domain registrar, configure the following records to point to our IPs:
        ns1.jetzed.com -> 13.248.158.180
        ns2.jetzed.com -> 75.2.118.134
        ns3.jetzed.com -> 76.223.26.245
        ns4.jetzed.com -> 99.83.147.209
Note: You don’t need to use all 4 IPs. Using the first two IPs will work perfectly fine.

    In the cPanel, add A records for the mentioned IPs.
Follow these steps:
    Navigate to your domain cPanel -> Zone Editor.

    Add the following A records:
        ns1.jetzed.com| A | 13.248.158.180
        ns2.jetzed.com| A | 75.2.118.134
        ns3.jetzed.com | A | 76.223.26.245
        ns4.jetzed.com | A | 99.83.147.209
		
Remember to wait for the propagation period of 24-48 hours for nameserver changes.
