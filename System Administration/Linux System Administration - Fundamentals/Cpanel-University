/usr/local/cpanel/ - this is where cPanel and WHM software lives
/usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/ - 3rd party subfolder for software that cpanel uses but did not develop (example: /perl, /mailman)
/usr/local/cpanel/base - the files that are loaded when accessing the cpanel/whm control panelurl.com/2087, /2083
/usr/local/cpanel/bin - binary files (executables) used via interface oprations or automated tasks
/usr/local/cpanel/Whostmgr, Cpanel - back-end Perl modules, mirroring the module names with the path. (.pm - perl module)
/usr/local/cpanel/logs/ - any logged data generated specifically by cPanel/WHM itself, such as with interface actions/errors, transfers, cPHulk, licensing, and tailwatchd, among others. (most important files: error_log, access_log).

/usr/bin/cpanel - important dir 1
/var/cpanel - important dir 2

restartsrv script - used to restart, start, stop services
	[actions]
	- stop
	- reload
	- status
	- restart
	- default option is restart

/scripts/restartsrv_exim --stop
/scripts/restartsrv [any cPanel service] --action 

when any of the above is executed, it will attempt to run it three times and if it fails it will report that it could not complete that action.

Restart Script Logic (/scripts/restartsrv):

if (service is known (service provided by cPanel))
	the respective service restart script is run. 
	/scripts/restartsrv exim -> /scripts/restartsrv_exim is executed with the provided arguments
else
	/scripts/restartsrv_unknown with any provided arguments is executed


Check Services Daemon (chkservd):
	chkservd monitors all services in /etc/chksrv.d/chksrvd.conf (cron, apache, IMAP, SSH, etc.)

Service Manager (in WHM) is the GUI for chkservd.

To create a new service, create a file in /etc/chkserv.d/service_name but the service will not appear in chkservd.conf until it is enabled in WHM.

TailWatch (tailwatchd) - monitors logs for certain activities (Tweak Settings)

MultiPHP (WHM -> Home -> Software -> MultiPHP Manager)
grep phpversion /var/cpanel/userdata/USERNAME/DOMAIN - check php version for the domain
WHM -> Home -> Software -> EasyApache 4 - to install a php version

EasyApache 4 allows you to use versions of PHP that are not provided by CPanel but can be installed with a package manager and cannot start with the "ea-" prefix that EasyApache 4 uses.

System PHP version - the PHP version that is set to default for all accounts on the server.

Handlers (Apache-to-PHP interface) - determines how Apache acts when a PHP file is requested.
DSO

Emails:
- exiwhat - active connections being handled
- ps -C exim wwwu - list of all running exim processes
- lsof -c exim - list of files being accessed by Exim

Testing IMAP - a good test is to ensure that Dovecot is authenticating and responding properly. You can do that with Telnet (yum install telnet) or openssl (openssl s_client -connect IpAddress

/var/log/exim_mainlog - main exim log
/var/log/maillog - dovecot and spam assasin log
/usr/local/cpanel/3rdparty/mailman/logs/* - mailman logs
/var/log/mail.log - dovecot log on Ubuntu

Exim main logs:
- /var/log/exim_mainlog - logs message arrival and delivery attempts, output is controlled by th log_selector option
- /var/log/exim_rejectlog - logs delivery rejections based on policy
- /var/log/exim_paniclog - logs severe errors (errors that cause Exim to crash), such as errors that cause a message to never be delivered, should be empty or nearly empty

Exim Message Status Indicators:
<= - message arrival (2015-03-13 09:20:29 1YWQRx-0008D8-LD <= root@hw1-x86.tech.cpanel.net)
=> - successful delivery (2015-03-11 10:35:36 1YVifY-0004Dw-KL => mary@cpanel.net)
== - deferred message (delayed) (2015-03-11 10:40:13 1YVik1-0004RW-Ef == root@hw1-x86.tech.cpanel.net)
** - delivery failure (2015-03-11 10:40:13 1YVik1-0004RW-Ef ** root@hw1-x86.tech.cpanel.net)

Exim ID vs Message ID:
Message ID (id=" " in the log file)
- IDs are unique across different systems and does not change. 
- It can be found in the logs and in the message headers.

Exim ID
- IDs are unique but are not guaranteed to be unique across systems in a network or over the internet.
- It is visible in the mail headers, but mostly used in exim_mainlog
- Every time a message reaches a server using Exim, a new Exim ID is assigned for the message on that server.

Routers and Transport:
2015-09-01 10:47:28 1ZWnmI-0001hA-Nb => dogs <dogs@animals.test> R=virtual_user T=virtual_userdelivery
R= - router
T= - transfer
- /etc/exim.conf - to check how the router or transport is instructed

Queue Runs:
Exim logs tell you when a queue run starts and what PID it is running as. During the run, the Exim process takes one message at a time and attempts to deliver it.

Current Working Dir (cwd=" "):
Exim logs the cwd of any process that invokes it. This way you can track where the mail is being sent from.
There will not be a cmw entry for mail received via SMTP.

2015-09-01 10:09:02 cwd=/var/spool/exim 2 args: /usr/sbin/exim -q

SpamAssassin Entries in the Exim log:
When SpamAssassin scans a message, it leaves a note in the Exim log [exim_mainlog] (2015-07-06 11:59:09 [13024] 1ZC3B5-0003O4-7s H=some.server.net [10.2.3.4]:58393 I=[10.9.8.7]:25 Warning: "SpamAssassin as testuser detected message as NOT spam (-100.4)")

The Dovecot Mail Log (/var/log/maillog), also IMAP log entries (IMAP logins) can be found in that log
