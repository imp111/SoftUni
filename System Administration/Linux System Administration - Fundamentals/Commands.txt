  Scheduling with "at":
  at 18:48                           - schedule a job at a exact time in the future (3 minutes after the current time)
  at now + 3 minutes                 - schedule a job using relative time (again 3 minutes after the current time)
  atq                                - checks the queue of the scheduled jobs
  atrm idOfJob                       - remove a job using the ID

  Scheduling with crond/cron (depending on the distribution):
  crontab -e                         - edit the crontab
  crontab -l                         - list all the crontab schedules
  
  /var/spool/cron/                   - contains all the cron jobs
