02. Networking Basics:

Types to connect a virtual machine to a network (Internet, LAN, etc.)
- External Connection (VirtualBox - Bridged, VMware - Bridged, Hyper-V - External Switch) which allows communication between:
	- VM to VM (the VM can communicate with other VMs)
	- VM to Host (the VM can communicate with the PC which hosts the VM)
	- VM to LAN (the VM can communicate with other devices in the physical local area network)

- Shared connection with NAT (Network Address Translating) (Shared connection with NATing allows for the VMs in the LAN to communicate with other devices through Internet - allow communication with the outside world) (Hyper-V - Internal Switch*, VirtualBox - NAT Network, VMWare - NAT) which allows communication between:
	- VM to VM
	- VM to Host
	- VM to LAN* (the * shows that Port Forwarding is needed)

- Shared connection (in this connection we don't have NATing, so the access to the outside world is not possible) (Hyper-V - Internal Switch, VirtualBox - Host-only Adapter, VMware - Host Only): 
	- VM to VM
	- VM to Host 

- Isolated connection (communication only between VMs) (Hyper-V - Private Switch, VirtualBox - Internal Network, VMware - Host Only*):
	- VM to VM

Network Models:
	- OSI Model Layers
		1. Phyisical
		2. Data-Link
		3. Network
		4. Transport
		5. Session
		6. Presentation
		7. Application

	- TCP/IP Protocol Architecture Layers
		1. Network Interface
		2. Internet
		4. Host-to-Host Transport
		5. Application

	- Protocols (protocol gives us set of rules which allows the devices to communicate with each other and we have protocols that operate on different layers):
		1. Ethernet / Token Ring
		2. IP (Internet Protocol - Handels addressing and communication between devices) (ARP, IGMP, ICMP (Internetr Control Message Protocol - networking devices such as routes are using it))
		3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol - complements IP and focuses on the transport of data packages), UDP (User Datagram Progocol - is like TCP, but it is connectionless, no error checking)
		4. Telnet, FTP, SMTP, DNS, RIP, SNMP

Common ports:

IP address is like a building and ports are the different apartments.
Ports point to some service.

	- Well-known ports (<1024)
		- 22 (SSH)
		- 53 (DNS)
		- 80 (HTTP)
		- 110 (POP3)
		- 123 (NTP)
		- 143 (IMAP)

	- Registered ports (<49152)
	- Dynamic

IP General Info:
- Terms
	- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6) - static or dynamic
		- IPv4 - one IPv4 address is 4 bytes long, which is 32 bits or 4 octets (4 sets of 8 bits or 4 sets of 1 bytes). It ranges from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. It is deviced in network and host parts. 
		- IPv6
	- Network mask (subnet mask) - it marks the border between two networks
	- Gateway address - it connects two networks (usualy this is the router)
	- Broadcast address - it is used for communication to all hosts on a network. It is the last address of a subnet and is the same for all.
