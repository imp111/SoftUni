02. Networking Basics:

Types to connect a virtual machine to a network (Internet, LAN, etc.)
- External Connection (VirtualBox - Bridged, VMware - Bridged, Hyper-V - External Switch) which allows communication between:
	- VM to VM (the VM can communicate with other VMs)
	- VM to Host (the VM can communicate with the PC which hosts the VM)
	- VM to LAN (the VM can communicate with other devices in the physical local area network)

- Shared connection with NAT (Network Address Translating) (Shared connection with NATing allows for the VMs in the LAN to communicate with other devices through Internet - allow communication with the outside world) (Hyper-V - Internal Switch*, VirtualBox - NAT Network, VMWare - NAT) which allows communication between:
	- VM to VM
	- VM to Host
	- VM to LAN* (the * shows that Port Forwarding is needed)

- Shared connection (in this connection we don't have NATing, so the access to the outside world is not possible) (Hyper-V - Internal Switch, VirtualBox - Host-only Adapter, VMware - Host Only): 
	- VM to VM
	- VM to Host 

- Isolated connection (communication only between VMs) (Hyper-V - Private Switch, VirtualBox - Internal Network, VMware - Host Only*):
	- VM to VM
