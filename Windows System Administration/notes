01. Intro to Windows Server:

	Requirements:
	- CPU: 64-bit CPU with VT-x (Intel) and AMD-V (AMD)
	- RAM: 4 - 8 GB
	- Disk space: 80 - 120 GB
	- Virtualization Software: Hyper-V, Virtualbox, VMware Workstation
	- ISO File: Windows Server 2019.iso
	- *Optional - Cloud Provider: Azure, AWS, GCP
	
	Architecture Overview:
	- Kernel Mode (Hypervisor context) - composed of multiple internal layers and services
		- Hyper-V Hypervisor - осигурява виртуализационните възможности в Windows Server

	- Kernel Mode
		- Hardware Abstraction Level (HAL) - Isolation layer between kernel, devices drivers, and executive and the platform-specific hardware. It is implemented in the hal.dll
		- Kernel - Low-level OS functions such as thread scheduling, interrupt and exception dispatching, and multiprocessor synchronization
		- Device Drivers - Both hardware (printers, etc.) and non-hardware (virtual devices) drivers
		- Windowing and Graphics - Implements graphical user interface (GUI) functions, also knows as the Windows USER and GDI functions.
		- Executive - Base OS services like memory management, process and thread management, security, I/O, networking and IPC

	- User Mode
		- NTDLL.DLL - Exports the Windows Native API and it the interface used by user-mode components of the operating system that must run without support from Win32 or other API
		- Subsystem DLLs - Sybsystem libraries implement various subsets of the Win32 API (KERNEL32.DLL, USER32.DLL, GDI32.DLL)
		- User Processes - Windows 32 or 64 bit processes
		- Service Processes - Host Windows services, the run independently of user logons 
		- System Processes - Servies like logon, not started by Service Control Manager
		- Environment Subsystems - Windows, OS/2, POSIX

	- Windows Server Datacenter
		- Purpose: For all companies with high requirements on IT workloads with large number of virtual systems
		- Virtualization: Unlimited virtual machines and Hyper-V Containers
		- Licensing Model: 
		- CAL requirements: Windows Server CAL (required for every user or device accessing a server)
		- RAM Limit: max 24 TB
		- CPU Limit: max 512 CPUs

02. Networking Basics:

	Types to connect a virtual machine to a network (Internet, LAN, etc.)
	- External Connection (VirtualBox - Bridged, VMware - Bridged, Hyper-V - External Switch) which allows communication between:
		- VM to VM (the VM can communicate with other VMs)
		- VM to Host (the VM can communicate with the PC which hosts the VM)
		- VM to LAN (the VM can communicate with other devices in the physical local area network)

	- Shared connection with NAT (Network Address Translating) (Shared connection with NATing allows for the VMs in the LAN to communicate with other devices through Internet - allow communication with the outside world) (Hyper-V - Internal Switch*, VirtualBox - NAT Network, VMWare - NAT) which allows communication between:
		- VM to VM
		- VM to Host
		- VM to LAN* (the * shows that Port Forwarding is needed)

	- Shared connection (in this connection we don't have NATing, so the access to the outside world is not possible) (Hyper-V - Internal Switch, VirtualBox - Host-only Adapter, VMware - Host Only): 
		- VM to VM
		- VM to Host 

	- Isolated connection (communication only between VMs) (Hyper-V - Private Switch, VirtualBox - Internal Network, VMware - Host Only*):
		- VM to VM

	Network Models:
	- OSI Model Layers
		1. Phyisical
		2. Data-Link
		3. Network
		4. Transport
		5. Session
		6. Presentation
		7. Application

	- TCP/IP Protocol Architecture Layers
		1. Network Interface
		2. Internet
		4. Host-to-Host Transport
		5. Application

	- Protocols (protocol gives us set of rules which allows the devices to communicate with each other and we have protocols that operate on different layers):
		1. Ethernet / Token Ring
		2. IP (Internet Protocol - Handels addressing and communication between devices) (ARP, IGMP, ICMP (Internetr Control Message Protocol - networking devices such as routes are using it))
		3. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol - complements IP and focuses on the transport of data packages), UDP (User Datagram Progocol - is like TCP, but it is connectionless, no error checking)
		4. Telnet, FTP, SMTP, DNS, RIP, SNMP

	Common ports:

	IP address is like a building and ports are the different apartments.
	Ports point to some service.

	- Well-known ports (<1024)
		- 22 (SSH)
		- 53 (DNS)
		- 80 (HTTP)
		- 110 (POP3)
		- 123 (NTP)
		- 143 (IMAP)

	- Registered ports (<49152)
	- Dynamic

	IP General Info:
	- Terms
		- IP address (IPv4 and IPv6) - static or dynamic
			- IPv4 - one IPv4 address is 4 bytes long, which is 32 bits or 4 octets (4 sets of 8 bits or 4 sets of 1 bytes). It ranges from 0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255. It is deviced in network and host part 
			- IPv6
		- Network mask (subnet mask) - it marks the border between two networks
		- Gateway address - it connects two networks (usualy this is the router)
		- Broadcast address - it is used for communication to all hosts on a network. It is the last address of a subnet and is the same for all.
